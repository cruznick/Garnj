<!-- /TOC -->

This package is based on [Gulp 4](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0), it uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for creating statics sites in an easy and expandable way, you can easly add another framework or library to the workflow

Every task and file is commented and I tried to be as explicit as I could when creating the comments but if you have any questions pleas open an [Issue](https://github.com/cruznick/Garnj/issues) and I will try to get at you Asap.

#
## Installation

This depends on:
- [Gulp 4.0.0](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0) ([Install instructions](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0))
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) ([Install instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/))
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (install depens on your SO)

You only need to preinstall Yarn, Ruby and for Gulp  use this:

```sh
$ yarn global add gulp-cli
```
After dependencies are installed run:

```
$ gulp
```

And you can start editing files inside the `_app` folder.
